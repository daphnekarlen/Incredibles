# Incredibles
This game shows 4.5 characters of the Incredibles with Edna being the main star that doesn't move and the other characters move around or through her. 
The reason I said that this game has 4.5 characters is because when JackJack intersects with Edna, he changes to an angry JackJack and a loud crash sound is played beacuse angry jackJack is very destructive and chaotic.
There is a background ambience of a suburban neighborhood to symbolize the normal world that the Incredibles family acts like they are a part of of, but they actually have superpowers and jackJack's crash sound reminds us of the actual life they live.
Mr. Incredible can not go through Edna and only bounces around her because in the movies, he is always trying to figure out what is happening to jackJack, but Edna is the only one who figures it out so the barrier represents the barrier of knowledge between the two.
The reason that Elastigirl wraps around the screen is because she is elastic, so she can wrap her body around things. 
Finally, jackJack changes character when he bounces onto Edna because when he was over at her house in the movies, he would always change into his different superpowers. 
Hope you enjoy!
